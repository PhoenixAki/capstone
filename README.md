This is my capstone project done in my final semester of my master's degree program. In essense, it was ChatGPT but a few years before ChatGPT existed (I take pride in effectively predicting it here), but developed by a single student on a more-or-less empty budget.

It is not runnable by cloning the repo, as I have left out the AI model that was used due to it being too larget for GitHub, and there are other setup steps required. I occasionally re-setup the project locally to demonstrate it to people, but its existence on GitHub is purely for history and archival sake for the rest of the codebase.
