This is my capstone project done in my final semester of my master's degree program. In essense, it was ChatGPT but a few years before ChatGPT existed (I take pride in effectively predicting it here), but developed by a single student on a more-or-less empty budget.

I'm not sure this is runnable simply by cloning in its current state - time allowing I will soon try to update it to be in a working state with minimal setup required, for archival purposes.
